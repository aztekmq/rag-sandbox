# RAG Sandbox (IBM MQ)

A single-container, production-ready Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) sandbox for IBM MQ documentation. The stack is built for 2025 best practices: llama.cpp inference with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Q5_K_M GGUF, Gradio 4 for a clean WebUI, Chroma persistence, Docling PDF parsing, and Snowflake Arctic embeddings. Everything runs fully offline—no external API calls once models are downloaded.

## RAG in Plain Language

Here’s **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** explained like you’re in **8th grade**:

---

### 🔍 **What is RAG? (Simple Explanation)**

Imagine you ask a super-smart robot a question. But sometimes the robot doesn't *remember* everything. So instead of guessing, the robot goes to look things up **right when you ask**.

RAG is basically the robot doing two steps:

---

### **1️⃣ Retrieval — “Let me go look that up.”**

The robot searches through a big collection of documents, files, or notes to find the most helpful information. It’s like Googling, but inside the robot’s brain.

---

### **2️⃣ Generation — “Now I’ll explain it to you.”**

After finding the info, the robot reads it and then writes a clear, helpful answer in its own words.

---

### 🧠 **Why is this useful?**

Because instead of making stuff up, the robot uses **real information** it just found. So answers are:

* more accurate
* more detailed
* based on real sources
* less likely to be wrong

---

### 💬 **Example**

**You ask:** *“What were the main causes of the Civil War?”*
**The robot:**

1. Searches your history textbook and notes.
2. Finds the paragraphs about slavery, states’ rights, and economics.
3. Writes an easy-to-understand answer using what it found.

---

### 📦 **In short:**

**RAG = Search + Explain** — a robot that first *looks things up* and then *gives you a smart answer.*

## Features
- **Admin mode**: upload IBM MQ PDFs, re-index, delete documents, view verbose logs, manage the knowledge base.
- **User mode**: simple chat interface with no upload rights.
- **Offline-first**: CPU/GPU llama.cpp backend and local embeddings keep data private.
- **Persistent storage**: PDFs, Chroma DB, and logs survive container restarts.

## Quickstart
1. **Clone and enter the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/rag-sandbox.git
   cd rag-sandbox
   ```

2. **Download the model (once, large download)**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p models
   wget -O models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf \
     https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q5_K_M.gguf
   ```

3. **Set credentials and model path**
   Create `.env` (ignored by git):
   ```env
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_me_strong_password
   USER_USERNAME=user
   USER_PASSWORD=mquser2025
   MODEL_PATH=/app/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-q5_k_m.gguf
   LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```

4. **Build and run via Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
   The app listens on http://localhost:7860.

5. **Login**
   - User mode → `user` / `mquser2025`
   - Admin mode → `admin` / your password

## Manual Docker build (optional)
```bash
docker build -t rag-sandbox .
docker run -d -p 7860:7860 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models \
  --env-file .env \
  --name mq-rag \
  rag-sandbox
```

## Force anonymous Docker builds (avoids credential helper issues)
If your Docker host is configured with credential helpers that are unavailable in this environment, use the helper script below to build anonymously with verbose logging for easier debugging:

```bash
./scripts/docker_build_anonymous.sh -t rag-sandbox .
```

The script sets a temporary, empty `DOCKER_CONFIG` directory so BuildKit pulls `docker/dockerfile:1` anonymously, then cleans up after the build. All arguments are forwarded to `docker build` so you can pass additional flags as needed.

## Operations
- **Upload PDFs (Admin)**: Add IBM MQ PDFs via the left panel, then click **Re-index all PDFs**. Files are stored in `/app/data/pdfs`.
- **Delete documents (Admin)**: Select a document from the dropdown and click **Delete selected** to remove its chunks from Chroma.
- **Chat (User/Admin)**: Ask IBM MQ questions; responses come from local retrieval + llama.cpp generation.

## Logging and Observability
- Logs are written to stdout and mirrored to `data/logs/app.log`; inspect with `docker logs mq-rag` or by reading the file from the mounted volume.
- Verbose logging is enabled by default (`LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` via docker compose); lower to `INFO` if you want quieter output once the system is stable.
- Python 3.11 builders should rebuild after pulling updates: Docling is pinned to `1.7.2` and `docling-parse` is locked at `4.7.1` to pull compatible parser wheels and avoid installation errors.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging
- **Import errors (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`)**: Always run the service as a module so Python resolves the `app` package correctly. Use `python -m app.main` locally or keep the default container command.
- **Enable/adjust verbosity**: Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (default) for detailed tracing in both stdout and `data/logs/app.log`. If troubleshooting noisy dependencies, briefly bump to `INFO`, then revert to `DEBUG` to retain rich context.
- **Validate environment variables**: Run `printenv | sort` inside the container to confirm credentials, `MODEL_PATH`, and logging settings are present. Missing values often lead to authentication failures or model loading errors.
- **Check persisted artifacts**: Confirm `/app/data/pdfs` and `/app/data/chroma_db` are mounted. Empty mounts can explain missing documents or retrieval mismatches.
- **Reset vector store**: If responses seem stale after PDF changes, remove `data/chroma_db` and re-run ingestion from the admin panel to rebuild embeddings.
- **Tail logs while reproducing**: Use `docker compose logs -f rag-sandbox` during reproduction so warnings and stack traces remain time-correlated with UI actions.

## Notes and Best Practices
- The container runs entirely offline after the initial model download.
- Ensure adequate CPU/RAM for the 8B model; adjust `MODEL_THREADS` and `MODEL_N_CTX` via environment variables if needed.
- For clean shutdowns and persistence, prefer `docker compose` with mounted volumes as shown above.

## Development
Install dependencies locally (Python 3.11 recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.main
```

## Security
- Store real secrets in `.env` or Docker secrets; never commit them.
- Default credentials are for local testing only—update them before production use.
